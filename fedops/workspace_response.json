For supply or construction contracts, the cost of materials is excluded and not considered to be subcontracted. When a contract includes both services and supplies, the 50 percent limitation shall apply only to the portion of the contract with the preponderance of the expenditure upon which the assigned NAICS is based.

The Government will award a Base Plus (4) Option Year  Firm-Fixed Price contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. \n(b) The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotations:\n1) Factor #1, Technical Capability\n2) Factor #2, Past Performance\n3) Factor #3, Price\n(c) Evaluation Approach. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Quotes will be evaluated by performing a comparative evaluation to determine which response represents the “best” as a whole. Quotes will be evaluated by performing a direct comparison of one offer with another in a uniform manner to determine which quote provides the government with its needs, as identified in the RFQ. The government reserves the right to consider a response that offers more than the minimum and select that response if it provides a benefit to the government. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:\n1) Factor #1, Technical Capability: The quotation will be evaluated to the extent to which it can meet and/or exceed the Government’s requirements as outlined in the solicitation and based on the information requested in the instructions to quoters section of the solicitation.\n2) Factor #2, Past Performance: The past performance evaluation will assess the relative risks associated with a quoter’s likelihood of success in fulfilling the solicitation’s requirements as indicated by the quoter’s record of past performance. The past performance evaluation may be based on the contracting officer’s knowledge of and previous experience with the supply or service being acquired; Customer surveys, and past performance questionnaire replies; Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) at http://www.cpars.gov/;  or any other reasonable basis.\n3) Factor #3, Veterans Involvement: Vendors that plan to sub-contract out services must complete Attachment B in Section D.  Failure to submit this attachment may result in your quote being ineligible for award and not further evaluated. Where it is apparent on the face of this form that more than 50% of the cost of the contract will be sub-contracted out to other small businesses, the quote will be ineligible for award and not further evaluated.\n4) Factor #3, Price: The Government will evaluate the price by adding the total of all line item prices in the pricelist. The Total Evaluated Price will be that sum. This includes base and all options.\n(d) Options. For the purposes of the award of this Contract, the Government intends to evaluate the option to extend services under FAR 52.217-8 as follows: \nThe evaluation will consider the possibility to extend the term of the contract. The evaluation will assume that the prices for any option exercised under FAR 52.217-8 will be at the same rates as those in effect under the contract at the time the option is exercised.  This evaluation will not obligate the Government to exercise any option under FAR 52.217-8.\n(e) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.\n(End of Provision)\nThe Bay Pines VAMC, 10000 Bay Pines Blvd, Bay Pines, FL 33744, has a requirement for a Base plus (2) Option Years for Medrad Preventive Maintenance (DirectCARE Basic).

The government reserves the right to consider a response that offers more than the minimum and select that response if it provides a benefit to the government. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:\n1) Factor #1, Technical Capability: The quotation will be evaluated to the extent to which it can meet and/or exceed the Government’s requirements as outlined in the solicitation and based on the information requested in the instructions to quoters section of the solicitation.\n2) Factor #2, Past Performance: The past performance evaluation will assess the relative risks associated with a quoter’s likelihood of success in fulfilling the solicitation’s requirements as indicated by the quoter’s record of past performance. The past performance evaluation may be based on the contracting officer’s knowledge of and previous experience with the supply or service being acquired; Customer surveys, and past performance questionnaire replies; Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) at http://www.cpars.gov/;  or any other reasonable basis.\n3) Factor #3, Veterans Involvement: Vendors that plan to sub-contract out services must complete Attachment B in Section D.  Failure to submit this attachment may result in your quote being ineligible for award and not further evaluated. Where it is apparent on the face of this form that more than 50% of the cost of the contract will be sub-contracted out to other small businesses, the quote will be ineligible for award and not further evaluated.\n4) Factor #3, Price: The Government will evaluate the price by adding the total of all line item prices in the pricelist. The Total Evaluated Price will be that sum. This includes base and all options.\n(d) Options. For the purposes of the award of this Contract, the Government intends to evaluate the option to extend services under FAR 52.217-8 as follows: \nThe evaluation will consider the possibility to extend the term of the contract. The evaluation will assume that the prices for any option exercised under FAR 52.217-8 will be at the same rates as those in effect under the contract at the time the option is exercised.  This evaluation will not obligate the Government to exercise any option under FAR 52.217-8.\n(e) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.\n(End of Provision)\nThe Bay Pines VAMC, 10000 Bay Pines Blvd, Bay Pines, FL 33744, has a requirement for a Base plus (2) Option Years for Medrad Preventive Maintenance (DirectCARE Basic).
